# Virtual Air Painting

Virtual Air Painting lets users draw in the air using a webcam and hand (or fingertip) tracking. The project captures hand movements, translates them into brush strokes, and renders those strokes on a virtual canvas in real time — enabling gesture-based drawing without physical pens or tablets.

## Key features
- Real-time hand / fingertip tracking to control the brush.
- Multiple brush sizes and colors.
- Clear / undo actions and option to save the canvas as an image.
- Lightweight and runs on a standard laptop with a webcam.
- Simple API or demo script for quick experimentation.

## Typical use cases
- Quick sketching and concept visualization without hardware.
- Educational demos for computer vision and interactive UI.
- Creative installations and gesture-driven art.

## Technology stack (example)
- Language: Python (or JavaScript — adjust to actual project stack)
- Computer vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe (or a similar hand-tracking library)
- GUI / rendering: OpenCV windows, Pygame, or web canvas if browser-based

## Installation (example)
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Mohan3044/Virtual-Air-Painting.git
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the demo:
   python demo.py

(Adjust commands to match the actual project files and entrypoint.)

## Usage
- Launch the demo script and allow webcam access.
- Use your index fingertip (or configured gesture) to paint in the air.
- Use keys or on-screen buttons to change color/brush size, clear the canvas, or save an image.

## Contributing
Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome. Please open an issue describing your idea or submit a pull request with a clean commit history and a clear description.

## Roadmap / Next steps
- Add configuration for different tracking backends (MediaPipe, TensorFlow, custom models).
- Improve gesture recognition (e.g., erase gesture, shape stamps).
- Add a web-based front-end for easier sharing and deployment.
- Include example screenshots and a short demo video/GIF in the README.
